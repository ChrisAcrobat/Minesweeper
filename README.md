This is an extract from old resume like project that has not been online for years. It's a Minesweeper clone and consist of a [singleplayer](https://chrisacrobat.github.io/Minesweeper/) and a [multiplayer](https://chrisacrobat.github.io/Minesweeper/) version. There is also a local high score [here](https://chrisacrobat.github.io/Minesweeper/Highscore/).<br>
This project contains some coding inconsistencies due to preserve old historic code.
